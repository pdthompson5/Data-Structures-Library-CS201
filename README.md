# Data-Structures-Library-CS201
This project is a c++ implentation of several common data structures. The supported data strucutres include circular dynamic arrays(CDA.cpp),
2-3-4 trees(Two4Tree.cpp), Binary heaps(Heap.cpp) and Binomial heaps(BHeap.cpp). In addtional to the necessary functions for the ADTs covered, there are also several optional functions.

## Usage
The primary use of this project is to act as a library. Each data structure can be imported into other c++ programs and used. 
The makefiles and sample main files found in the project folders display examples of the functionalities of this project.

## Documentation 
Above each public method there are block comments explaining its functionality. 

## Status 
The Project1 is tested and works properly 
All of Project2 is complete; however some functionality is broken. Specifically the Rank() and Select() functions do not work properly.
Most of Project3 is complete. The Binary Heap specifically appears to be fully functional. The binomial heap is not complete. Specifically no delete function is implemented so there are significant memory leaks.
